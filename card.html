			<p class="interestingfact">Randy was named after the song "Brandy," by The Looking Glass, because he was found on a boat with his litter mates.
      Since he was born sailing the seven seas on aforementioned boat, his name needed to be vaguely nautical themed while still kind of masculine. Hence, Randy!

				<li><span>Favorite Beverage</span>: Toilet Water</li>
				<li><span>Species</span>: Cat (or alien)</li>
				<li><span>Temperament</span>: Hyper at bedtime.</li>
				<li><span>Favorite phrase</span>: Sassy Meow.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Randy is a clear example of what it means to be a true gentleman in the modern age; seemingly hopelessly romantic,
misunderstood, and old fashioned.
